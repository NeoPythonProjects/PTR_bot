questions
---------
1. can we use the extra dimensions that are in the claim data?


inputs
------
1. minimum premium threshold
2. current uy; 
  2.1. currently the claims table holds dev_q field which is the development of the claim based on ncurrent date and open date; however, we need the dev at uy level (current year - uy + 1)*4; this formula is applied during the upload_claims_csv() process instead of uploading the dev_q in the table. 
 2.2. currently the claims table holds the curretn date; we could have the current uy as an input parameter instead of a data field; formula in 2.1. needs to be adjusted to take input parameter instead of data field


mysql database
--------------
holds 5 data tables, all with dummy data:
claims, premium, expenses, patterns and ieulrs

process tables are added as needed, e.g. used_tradecodes holds the result of a query that shows the lob-tradecode combinations that are in use based on the claims data, premium data and premium threshold (all need to apply as linked via INNER JOINs). 
-> aim is to reduce the number of needless permutations

This database is just there for the proof of concept. In the proper application this will likely be a link into Snowflake tables

double inner joins: INNER JOIN ... AND`
multiple links to same table:
  INNER JOIN ... as t1
  INNER JOIN ... as t2

filtering the data
------------------
Filtering to happen on both claims and premiums to calculate BF
There are more dimensions in the claims data.

We could loop through all possible combos of dimensions, but that would increase runtime significantly, as every combo needs to be checked against the premium file to see if it exceeds the minimum premoium threshold.

field - combos
//////////////
We need to decide on a combo of dimensions, e.g. tradecode-dim2; the premium data needs to have these dimensions too; then group premium and claims tables to the same level
Before calculating BF, check that the combo exceeds the --> minimum premium threshold <--
Run a SQL query on the claims table to list all existing combos
For these combos, check that they exceed the premium threshold; if so,s store in staging table.
Stagingtable holds the combos for which the BF will be calculated.


row - combos
////////////
We need to allow for several tradecodes to be selected together

calculations
------------
select dimension, or more than one
aggregate claims and premium table to that dimension (GROUP BY and WHERE)
need lob, uy, dev, incd WHERE dimensions are as selected
lob and uy inner join for ieulr
lob and dev (or uy) inner join for ftu (1-1 between dev and uy, so can link on either)
lob and uy for premium
calculate BF
store in a file or database
premium and claims tables to be aggregated to same level of dimensions

will need separate queries for different number of dimensions
- tradecodes
- tradecodes and dim 2
- trade codes and dim 3
