questions
---------
1. can we use the extra dimensions that are in the claim data?

inputs
------
1. minimum premium threshold


mysql database
--------------
holds 5 tables, all with dummy data:
claims, premium, expenses, patterns and ieulrs

This database is just there for the proof of concept. In the proper application this will likely be a link into Snowflake tables

filtering the data
------------------
Filtering to happen on both claims and premiums to calculate BF
There are more dimensions in the claims data.

We could loop through all possible combos of dimensions, but that would increase runtime significantly, as every combo needs to be checked against the premium file to see if it exceeds the minimum premoium threshold.

field - combos
//////////////
We need to decide on a combo of dimensions, e.g. tradecode-dim2; the premium data needs to have these dimensions too
Before calculating BF, check that the combo exceeds the --> minimum premium threshold <--
Run a SQL query on the claims table to list all existing combos
For these combos, check that they exceed the premium threshold; if so,s store in staging table.
Stagingtable holds the combos for which the BF will be calculated.


row - combos
////////////
We need to allow for several tradecodes to be selected together
